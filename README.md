For the Orange Bowl 2025, Kaylor is going under the total (45.5), despite it being a full eight points lower than the other College Football Playoff semifinal between Texas and Ohio State. Both of these defenses rank top 10 in the nation in scoring defense, with Notre Dame allowing 13.6 points per game (second in the country) and Penn State allowing 15.8 points per game (seventh).

The Fighting Irish had to overcome the loss of their top defensive lineman (Rylie Mills) in the quarterfinals but they were still able to apply relentless pressure on Georgia. Notre Dame had four sacks and had nine tackles for loss in the win. Meanwhile, Penn State has one of the nation's best edge rushers in Abdul Carter (22 tackles for loss and 11 sacks) and just held Heisman Trophy runner-up Ashton Jeanty to 3.5 yards per carry in its quarterfinal win over Boise State.

Notre Dame has dominated the line of scrimmage all season, and that continued against Georgia in their CFP quarterfinal matchup last week. Penn State should make life difficult for Notre Dame's offense," Kaylor told SportsLine. See which side to back right here.
